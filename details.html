                        <h3>A Note About Our Celebration</h3>
                        <p>We absolutely love your children and the joy they bring to our lives! They are such an important part of our lives, and we're honored that you share them with us.</p>

                        <p>For this special evening, we want to give the amazing parents behind the amazing kids a well-deserved night to relax, celebrate, and enjoy yourselves without worrying about bedtimes or little ones.</p>

                        <p><strong>Children are warmly welcome at the ceremony</strong>, and we'd love to have them witness our vows. However, due to space limitations, the reception will be an adults-only celebration.</p>

                        <p>We completely understand that some of you may still be breastfeeding. If this applies to you, please reach out to us directly—we'll make arrangements to ensure you and your little one are comfortable.</p>

                        <p>We hope you understand and are able to enjoy a rare evening out. We can't wait to celebrate with you!</p>
